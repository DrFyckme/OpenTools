- Functionality to check for 'wrong' code; reads selected line for stuff like unused parameters having values, wrong comments, incorrect use of parameters, etc. etc
- Checkbox if the user wants to fill in smart_scripts.id gaps
- Possibly take the workspace-idea by Event Horizon
- Checkbox to only show event_types and action_types for the chosen source_type (so for gameobjects we would hide SMART_EVENT_SPELLHIT, etc.)
- Possibly pick another logo, this is ugly and boring
- Find a good-looking way to display _ALL_ info in the listview without having to scroll (is there any?)
- Make the application support more platforms than just Windows
- Create a checkbox to only show 'basic' data in the listview (entryorguid, id, event_type, action_type, target_type, comment)
  - Also implement this in the SearchForLink form
- Implement the 'Link from' field
- Allow resizing the application but just make everything scroll-able if it becomes smaller
- (?) Implement a sqlite database containing required tables for the tool (creature_template, creature, gameobject, smart_scripts, etc.) and use this if user wants to not use his local database
  - Figure out why the 'finally' block is called right when we call FillListViewWithSpells instead of actually waiting till the process finished, possibly related to above line...
- (?) Possible move the parameter button handling (like SMART_ACTION_CAST -> param1 has a button to search for spells) to the SQLite database so we have less code in the application?
- Find a way around the annoying 500-line limit when inserting SQLite data. When found, implement all sounds into the SQLite database.
- Fix the logic of the multiselectform (try with unit flags to see how it's broken)
- Load tooltips on startup
- Add a setting whether or not the user wants to use tooltips at all? To reduce start-up time (once we load them on startup)
- Only enable target coordinate parameter fields for action types that actually use them
- Make permanent tooltips support multilines OR decrease length of tooltips to a fixed size...
- Add a preference or setting to hide unused parameters? Or hide them by default?
- Implement SAI conditions support
- Implement creature text support (?)
- Convert all 'new xxxForm().ShowDialog(this)' to use 'using'
- When searching for a script like 33303's (creature) and also listing actionlists, the sort order changes every search (new bug?)

Needs to be further into development:
- Make all tabindexes work completely (need to finish pretty much everything before doing this)
- Improve implementation of the SearchForLinkForm to do the following:
  - Only allow to link to lines with a higher smart_scripts.id
    - This could possibly also be implemented as a feature to refactor the SAI of the creature with the id's to be re-ordered (posibly based on a YesNo messagebox question)
  - We also need to adjust the id chosen to link from/to so the script will still work
